###### I have used HTML, CSS and java script to build this website along with grid and flex to minimize code writing and array of object model to store data easily . Used local storage to store and retrieve data from it. the website lets you sign-in using sign-in page, if your do not have account then it lets you to sign-up first.

###### After sign-in, we can add products from various product pages, in pages i have added a functionality to sort and filter data as need. Product page has a button which lets you add the particular product top to cart.

###### Cart page has all the products you moved to cart from product page and it shows the no of items in the cart along with the total price and a procedd to payment page button.

###### Payment pages has all the field for card details and address details, enter all the details to move ahead with payment.

Thanks,
Anjana Kushwaha
