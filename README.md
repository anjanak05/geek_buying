I have used HTML, CSS and java script to build this website along with grid and flex to minimize code writing and array of object model to store data easily . Used local storage to store and retrieve data from it. the website lets you sign-in using sign-in page, if your do not have account then it lets you to sign-up first.

After sign-in, we can add products from various product pages, in pages i have added a functionality to sort and filter data as need. Product page has a button which lets you add the particular product top to cart.

Cart page has all the products you moved to cart from product page and it shows the no of items in the cart along with the total price and a procedd to payment page button.

Payment pages has all the field for card details and address details, enter all the details to move ahead with payment.

Thanks,

Anjana Kushwaha
